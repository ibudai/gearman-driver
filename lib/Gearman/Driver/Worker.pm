Gearman::Driver::Worker - Base class for workers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package My::Worker;

    use base qw(Gearman::Driver::Worker);
    use Moose;

    sub begin {
        # called before each job
    }

        return join '_', split /::/, __PACKAGE__;
    }

        my ( $self, $job ) = @_;
        # $job => Gearman::XS::Job instance
    }

    sub end {
        # called after each job
    }

        my ( $self, $job ) = @_;

        my $gc = Gearman::XS::Client->new;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 server

L<Gearman::Driver> connects to the L<server|Gearman::Driver/server>
passed to its constructor. This value is also stored in this class.
This can be useful if a job uses L<Gearman::XS::Client> to add
another jobs. See 'spread_work' method in L</SYNOPSIS> above.

=cut

has 'server' => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => 'Str',
    required => 1,
);

=head1 METHODATTRIBUTES

=head2 Job

This will register the method with gearmand.

=head2 MinChilds

Minimum number of childs working parallel on this job/method.

=head2 MaxChilds

Maximum number of childs working parallel on this job/method.

=head2 Encode

This will automatically look for a method C<encode> in this object
which has to be defined in the subclass. It will call the C<encode>
method passing the return value from the job method. The return
value of the C<encode> method will be returned to the Gearman
client. This is useful to serialize Perl datastructures to JSON
before sending them back to the client.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 prefix

Having the same method name in two different classes would result
in a clash when registering it with gearmand. To avoid this,
all jobs are registered with the full package and method name
(e.g. C<My::Worker::some_job>). The default prefix is
C<ref(shift . '::')>, but this can be changed by overriding the
C<prefix> method in the subclass, see L</SYNOPSIS> above.

=cut

sub prefix {
    return ref(shift) . '::';
}

=head2 begin

This method is called before a job method is called. In this base
class this methods just does nothing, but can be overridden in a
subclass.

The parameters are the same as in the job method:

=over 4

=item * C<$self>

=item * C<$job>

=back

=cut

sub begin { }

=head2 end

This method is called after a job method has been called. In this
base class this methods just does nothing, but can be overridden
in a subclass.

The parameters are the same as in the job method:

=over 4

=item * C<$self>

=item * C<$job>

=back

=cut

sub end { }

sub decode {
    my ( $self, $result ) = @_;
    return $result;
}

sub encode {
    my ( $self, $result ) = @_;
    return $result;
}

no Moose;
