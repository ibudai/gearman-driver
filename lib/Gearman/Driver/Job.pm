=head1 NAME

Gearman::Driver::Job - Handles the POE magic

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is responsible for starting/stopping processes as well as
handling all pipes (STDOUT/STDERR/STDIN) of the processes. All events
are written to a logfile. Possible events are:

=over 4

=item * Starting processes

=item * STDOUT of processes

=item * STDERR of processes

=item * Stopping processes

=back

The current interface may only be interesting for people subclassing
L<Gearman::Driver> or for people writing commands/extensions for
L<Gearman::Driver::Console>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 driver

Reference to the L<Gearman::Driver> instance.

=cut

has 'driver' => (
    handles  => { log => 'log' },
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => 'Gearman::Driver',
    required => 1,
    weak_ref => 1,
);

=head2 name

The job's name.

=cut

has 'name' => (
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => 'Str',
    required => 1,
);

=head2 method

Code reference which is run called by L<Gearman::XS::Worker>.
Actually it's not called directly by it, but in a wrapped coderef.

=cut

has 'method' => (
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => 'CodeRef',
    required => 1,
);

=head2 worker

Reference to the worker object.

=cut

has 'worker' => (
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => 'Any',
    required => 1,
);

=head2 server

A list of Gearman servers the workers should connect to. The format
for the server list is: C<host[:port][,host[:port]]>

It's the same value as in L<Gearman::Driver/server>.

=cut

has 'server' => (
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => 'Str',
    required => 1,
);

=head2 max_processes

Maximum number of concurrent processes this job may have.

=cut

has 'max_processes' => (
    default  => 1,
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => 'Int',
    required => 1,
);

=head2 min_processes

Minimum number of concurrent processes this job may have.

=cut

has 'min_processes' => (
    default  => 1,
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => 'Int',
    required => 1,
);

=head2 encode

This may be set to a method name which is implemented in the worker
class or any subclass. If the method is not available, it will fail.
The returned value of the job method is passed to this method and
the return value of this method is sent back to the Gearman server.

See also: L<Gearman::Driver::Worker/Encode>.

=cut

has 'encode' => (
    default  => '',
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => 'Str',
    required => 1,
);

=head2 decode

This may be set to a method name which is implemented in the worker
class or any subclass. If the method is not available, it will fail.
The workload from L<Gearman::XS::Job> is passed to this method and
the return value is passed as argument C<$workload> to the job
method.

See also: L<Gearman::Driver::Worker/Decode>.

=cut

has 'decode' => (
    default  => '',
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => 'Str',
    required => 1,
);

=head2 processes

This attribute stores a key/value pair containing:
C<$pid> => L<$job|Gearman::Driver::Job>

It provides following methods:

=over 4

=item * C<count_processes()>

=item * C<delete_process($pid)>

=item * C<get_process($pid)>

=item * C<get_processes()>

=item * C<get_pids()>

=item * C<set_process($pid => $job)>

    },
    is     => 'ro',
    isa    => 'HashRef',
    traits => [qw(Hash)],
);

=head2 gearman

Instance of L<Gearman::XS::Worker>.

=cut

has 'gearman' => (
    is  => 'ro',
    isa => 'Gearman::XS::Worker',
);

=head2 session

Instance of L<POE::Session>.

=cut

has 'session' => (
    is  => 'ro',
    isa => 'POE::Session',
);

=head2 cache

An instance of L<Cache::FastMmap> is used to share data between the
parent and child processes. This is necessary to set L<lastrun>,
L<lasterror> and L<lasterror_msg> in the child processes and make
the values available in the parent process.

=cut

has 'cache' => (
    default => sub {
        Cache::FastMmap->new(
            share_file  => '/tmp/gearman_driver.cache',

        );
    },
    is   => 'ro',
    isa  => 'Cache::FastMmap',
    lazy => 1,
);

=head2 lastrun

Each time this job is called it stores C<time()> in this attribute
as well was in the L</cache>.

This depends on L<Gearman::Driver/extended_status>.

=cut

has 'lastrun' => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => 'Int',
    trigger => sub {

        my $key = sprintf '%s_lastrun', $self->name;
        $self->cache->set( $key => $value );
    }
);

=head2 lasterror

Each time this job failed it stores C<time()> in this attribute
as well was in the L</cache>.

This depends on L<Gearman::Driver/extended_status>.

=cut

has 'lasterror' => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => 'Int',
    trigger => sub {
        my ( $self, $value ) = @_;
        my $key = sprintf '%s_lasterror', $self->name;
        $self->cache->set( $key => $value );
    }
);

=head2 lasterror_msg

Each time this job failed it stores the error message in this
attribute as well was in the L</cache>.

This depends on L<Gearman::Driver/extended_status>.

=cut

has 'lasterror_msg' => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => 'Str',
    trigger => sub {
        my ( $self, $value ) = @_;
        my $key = sprintf '%s_lasterror_msg', $self->name;
        $self->cache->set( $key => $value );
    }
