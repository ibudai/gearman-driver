=head1 DESCRIPTION

By default L<Gearman::Driver> provides a management console which can
be used with a standard telnet client. It's possible to list all
running worker processes as well as changing min/max processes
on runtime.

Each successful L<command|/COMMANDS> ends with a dot. If a
command throws an error, a line starting with 'ERR' will be
returned.

            if ( $self->can($command) ) {
                try {
                    my @result = $self->$command(@params);
                    $heap->{client}->put($_) for @result;

                }
                catch {
                    chomp($_);
                    $heap->{client}->put($_);

            else {

                # the damn client may have disconnected before we can send something
                try {
                    $heap->{client}->put("ERR unknown_command: $command");
                };
            }
        }
    );
}

=head1 COMMANDS

All basic commands are implemented in
L<Gearman::Driver::Console::Basic>. It's very easy to extend this
console with new commands. Every module found in namespace
C<Gearman::Driver::Console::*> will be loaded. Each of those
modules has to be implemented as a L<Moose::Role>. You've got
access to two attributes/methods there:

=over 4

=item * C<driver> - reference to the L<Gearman::Driver> object

=item * C<server> - reference to the L<POE::Component::TCP::Server> object

=item * C<get_job($name)> - returns a L<Gearman::Driver::Job> object

=back

So a new command could look like:

    package Gearman::Driver::Console::List;

    use Moose::Role;

    sub list {
        my ($self) = @_;
        my @result = ();
        foreach my $job ( $self->driver->get_jobs ) {
            push @result, $job->name;
        }
        return @result;
    }

    1;

If you need to throw an error, just die and everything will work as
expected (as long as you do not forget the C<\n>):

    package Gearman::Driver::Console::Broken;

    use Moose::Role;

    sub broken {
        my ($self) = @_;
        die "ERR this is a broken command\n";
    }

    sub get_max_processes {
        my ( $self, $job_name ) = @_;
        my $job = $self->get_job($job_name); # this automatically dies if job is not found
        return $job->max_processes;
    }

    1;

Yes, that's all...

    $ ~/Gearman-Driver$ telnet localhost 47300
    Trying ::1...
    telnet: connect to address ::1: Connection refused
    Trying fe80::1...
    telnet: connect to address fe80::1: Connection refused
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.

    .

sub get_job {
    my ( $self, $job_name ) = @_;
    return $self->driver->get_job($job_name) || die "ERR invalid_job_name: $job_name\n";
}
