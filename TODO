* write more tests
* write more docs
* add more examples
* cleanup test mess
* doc scripts/gearman_driver.pl somewhere
* rework log messages
* make MaxIdleTime configurable per job as new attribute
* make client with readline support

* implement some shared stash with different backends (e.g. memcached) to have
  shared data across multiple worker childs (running on multiple servers). Some
  smart locking is necessary! Not sure yet if this is a smart idea at all.
  e.g.:
  package My::Worker;
  use base qw(Gearman::Driver::Worker);
  use Moose;
  sub do_something : Job : MinChilds(2) : MaxChilds(15) {
    my ( $self, $job, $workload ) = @_;
    $self->stash->set( foo => 'bar' );
    $self->stash->get('foo');
  }
