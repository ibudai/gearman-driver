NAME
    Gearman::Driver - Manages Gearman workers

SYNOPSIS
        package My::Workers::One;

        use base qw(Gearman::Driver::Worker);
        use Moose;

        # this method will be registered with gearmand as 'My::Workers::One::scale_image'
        sub scale_image : Job {
            my ( $self, $job ) = @_;
            # do something
        }

        # this method will be registered with gearmand as 'My::Workers::One::do_something_else'
        sub do_something_else : Job : MinChilds(2) : MaxChilds(15) {
            my ( $self, $job ) = @_;
            # do something
        }

        # this method wont be registered with gearmand at all
        sub do_something_internal {
            my ( $self, $job ) = @_;
            # do something
        }

        1;

        package My::Workers::Two;

        use base qw(Gearman::Driver::Worker);
        use Moose;

        # this method will be registered with gearmand as 'My::Workers::Two::scale_image'
        sub scale_image : Job {
            my ( $self, $job ) = @_;
            # do something
        }

        1;

        package main;

        use Gearman::Driver;

        my $driver = Gearman::Driver->new(
            namespaces => [qw(My::Workers)],
            server     => 'localhost:4730,otherhost:4731',
            interval   => 60,
        );

        $driver->run;

DESCRIPTION
    Having hundreds of Gearman workers running in separate processes can
    consume a lot of RAM. Often many of these workers share the same
    code/objects, like the database layer using DBIx::Class for example.
    This is where Gearman::Driver comes in handy:

    You write some base class which inherits from Gearman::Driver::Worker.
    Your base class loads your database layer for example. Each of your
    worker classes inherit from that base class. In the worker classes you
    can register single methods as jobs with gearmand. It's even possible to
    control how many workers doing that job/method in parallel. And this is
    the point where you'll save some RAM: Instead of starting each worker in
    a separate process Gearman::Driver will fork each worker from the main
    process. This will take advantage of copy-on-write on Linux and save
    some RAM.

    There's only one mandatory parameter which has to be set when calling
    the constructor: namespaces

        use Gearman::Driver;
        my $driver = Gearman::Driver->new( namespaces => [qw(My::Workers)] );

    See also: namespaces. If you do not set server (gearmand) attribute the
    default will be used: "localhost:4730"

    Each module found in your namespace will be loaded and introspected,
    looking for methods having the 'Job' attribute set:

        package My::Workers::ONE;

        sub scale_image : Job {
            my ( $self, $job ) = @_;
            # do something
        }

    This method will be registered as job function with gearmand, verify it
    by doing:

        plu@mbp ~$ telnet localhost 4730
        Trying ::1...
        Connected to localhost.
        Escape character is '^]'.
        status
        My::Workers::ONE::scale_image   0       0       1
        .
        ^]
        telnet> Connection closed.

    If you dont like to use the full package name you can also specify a
    custom prefix:

        package My::Workers::ONE;

        sub prefix { 'foo_bar_' }

        sub scale_image : Job {
            my ( $self, $job ) = @_;
            # do something
        }

    This would register 'foo_bar_scale_image' with gearmand.

    See also: prefix

ATTRIBUTES
  namespaces
    Will be passed to Module::Find "useall" method to load worker modules.
    Each one of those modules has to be inherited from
    Gearman::Driver::Worker or a subclass of it. It's also possible to use
    the full package name to load a single module/file. There is also a
    method get_namespaces which returns a sorted list of all namespaces.

    * isa: "ArrayRef"
    * required: "True"

  server
    A list of Gearman servers the workers should connect to. The format for
    the server list is: "host[:port][,host[:port]]"

    See also: Gearman::XS

    * default: "localhost:4730"
    * isa: "Str"

  interval
    Each n seconds Net::Telnet::Gearman is used in Gearman::Driver::Observer
    to check status of free/running/busy workers on gearmand. This is used
    to fork more workers depending on the queue size and the
    MinChilds/MaxChilds attribute of the job method. See also:
    Gearman::Driver::Worker

    * default: 5
    * isa: "Int"

  logfile
    Path to logfile.

    * isa: "Str"
    * default: "gearman_driver.log"

  loglayout
    See also Log::Log4perl.

    * isa: "Str"
    * default: "[%d] %m%n"

  loglevel
    See also Log::Log4perl.

    * isa: "Str"
    * default: "INFO"

  unknown_job_callback
    Whenever Gearman::Driver::Observer sees a job that isnt handled it will
    call this CodeRef, passing following arguments:

    * $driver
    * $status

        my $driver = Gearman::Driver->new(
            namespaces           => [qw(My::Workers)],
            unknown_job_callback => sub {
                my ( $driver, $status ) = @_;
                # notify nagios here for example
            }
        );

    $status might look like:

        $VAR1 = {
            'busy'    => 0,
            'free'    => 0,
            'name'    => 'GDExamples::Sleeper::unknown_job',
            'queue'   => 6,
            'running' => 0
        };

INTERNAL ATTRIBUTES
    This might be interesting for subclassing Gearman::Driver.

  modules
    Every worker module loaded by Module::Find will be added to this list.
    There are also two methods: get_modules and has_modules.

    * isa: "ArrayRef"
    * readonly: "True"

  jobs
    Stores all Gearman::Driver::Job instances. The key is the name the job
    gets registered with gearmand. There are also two methods: get_job and
    has_job.

    Example:

        {
            'My::Workers::ONE::scale_image'       => bless( {...}, 'Gearman::Driver::Job' ),
            'My::Workers::ONE::do_something_else' => bless( {...}, 'Gearman::Driver::Job' ),
            'My::Workers::TWO::scale_image'       => bless( {...}, 'Gearman::Driver::Job' ),
        }

    * isa: "HashRef"
    * readonly: "True"

  observer
    Instance of Gearman::Driver::Observer.

    * isa: "Gearman::Driver::Observer"
    * readonly: "True"

METHODS
    Every method except run might only be interesting for people subclassing
    Gearman::Driver.

  run
    This must be called after the Gearman::Driver object is instantiated.

  get_namespaces
    Returns a sorted list of namespaces.

  get_modules
    Returns a sorted list of modules.

  has_modules
    Returns the count of modules.

  has_job
    Params: $name

    Returns true/false if the job exists.

  get_job
    Params: $name

    Returns the job instance.
