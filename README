        use base qw(Gearman::Driver::Worker);
        use Moose;

        # this method will be registered at gearmand as 'My::Workers::One::scale_image'
        sub scale_image : Job {}

        # this method will be registered at gearmand as 'My::Workers::One::do_something_else'
        sub do_something_else : Job : MinProcs(2) : MaxProcs(15) {}

        # this method wont be registered at gearmand at all
        sub do_something_internal {}

        package My::Workers::Two;

        use base qw(Gearman::Driver::Worker);
        use Moose;

        # this method will be registered at gearmand as 'My::Workers::Two::scale_image'
        sub scale_image : Job {}

        package main;

        use Gearman::Driver;

        my $driver = Gearman::Driver->new_with_options(
            namespaces => [qw(My::Workers)],
            server     => 'localhost:4730,otherhost:4731',
            interval   => 60,
        );

        $driver->run;

DESCRIPTION
ATTRIBUTES
  namespaces
    Will be passed to Module::Find "useall" method to load worker modules.
    Each one of those modules has to be inherited from
    Gearman::Driver::Worker or a subclass of it. It's also possible to use
    the full module name to load a single module.

    * isa: ArrayRef
    * required: True

  modules
    Every worker module loaded by Module::Find will be added to this list.

    * isa: ArrayRef
    * readonly: True

  wheels
    Stores all Gearman::Driver::Wheel instances. The key is the name the job
    gets registered on Gearman.

    * isa: HashRef
    * readonly: True

  server
    A list of Gearman servers the workers should connect to. The format for
    the server list is: "host[:port][,host[:port]]"

    * default: localhost:4730
    * isa: Str

  interval
    Each n seconds Net::Telnet::Gearman is used in Gearman::Driver::Observer
    to check status of free/running/busy workers on Gearman. This is used to
    fork more workers depending on the queue size and the MinProcs/MaxProcs
    attribute of the job method. See also: Gearman::Driver::Worker

    * default: 5
    * isa: Int

  observer
    Instance of Gearman::Driver::Observer.

    * isa: Gearman::Driver::Observer
    * readonly: True

  logfile
    * isa: Str
    * default: gearman_driver.log

METHODS
  run
        This must be called after the Gearman::Driver object is
        instantiated.
